  - features        ==>> for the feature files
  - utilities       ==>> for the reusable method class, driver class etc.
  - stepdefinitions ==>> stepdefinitions classes

What is Feature file : In cucumber "Feature" is a key component used to describe
a specific functionality or aspect of the application being tested in readable and understandable format
actually we are using feature for the user story ==> each user story should be added different fetaure file

TestNG  ===> POM (Page Object Model)
JUnit   ===> POM (Page Object Model)

Cucumber ==>> BDD (Behavior Driven Development)
Most Important Benefit of Cucumber ===> Non-technical team members and developers can understand (BA, PO, PM )
